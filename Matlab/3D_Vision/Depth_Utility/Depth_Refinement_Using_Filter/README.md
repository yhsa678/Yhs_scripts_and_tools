- depth map refinement using popular filters, e.g. weighted median filter, and cross-based local multi-point filter
	- temporarily, no parameter is opened, for fast testing only
	- call .exe without command line could invoke the gui to tune the parameters
	- weighted median filter is very slow for large image
	- would wrap into mex file to give more control in the future
